A little project of programming fundamentals to get started into the C lenguaje.
* Non - Object Oriented Programming. 
* Use of simple functions.
* Use of a basic MS-DOS graphic library.

Both source & header files are uploaded here, to use it you just need to create a project with some IDE(I used Visual Studio), copile and run.
